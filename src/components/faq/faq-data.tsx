    answer: `At OpenBC, we're a mix of seasoned pros and eager learners,
      all excited about trying new stuff. Feel free to use your know-how
      to speed things up and help the team, but remember, we're all
      about diving into new things here. If you&apos;re picking up a new
      role, just a heads up: you might need to put in some extra time on
      your own to get the hang of it and get your tasks done.`,
